# GirlGene

*It's merely a semi-manufactured POC. it has not been tested for production.*

## Background

GirlGene is a Dapp built on EOS which we had developed within limited 24 hours for a hackathon, thus we failed to full implement our amazing ideas.

Given the topic of "IP preservation" and "game ecology", we designed a *CryptoKitty-like* game focusing on the interaction among character IPs which not only values IPs of ERC721-based games but also provide a communication platform for variant EOS dapps.

## Features

- ERC721 token

We build ERC-721 non-fungible tokens, and generate girl portraits via GAN. Each girl's *noise* is what we called *a girl gene*, and this is the IP for a corresponding token which is stored on chain.

- mall

We provide a mall from which players can pick a favorite girl.

**TODO:** multiple properties (e.g. hat, glasses etc.) may enrich playability.

- reproduction

Two girls' genes can be mixed to produce a new gene.

- integration

**TODO:** characters from different ERC-721 based games may be integrated to form a new character with both properties.
